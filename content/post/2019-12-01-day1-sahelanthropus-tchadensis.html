<p>This fossil dates to between ~7-6 million years ago and thus may be the earliest hominin known. It was found in the Toros-Menalla area of the Djurab Desert of northern Chad.</p>

<p>The fossil was <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dlieberman/files/2005a.pdf">first published in 2002</a>, with subsequent material published <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dlieberman/files/2005a.pdf">in 2005</a>. Scientists argued that it was bipedal based mostly on the placement of the <em>foramen magnum</em>, the large hole at the base of the skull through which the spinal column attaches to the skull. Its placement tells us something about how the neck is held.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hominins tend to have this hole placed more towards the front of their skull to support upright posture. Debate exists, though, about how forwardly placed this hole is.</p>
<p>The size and shape of its canine has also been examined for clues to its affiliation with our lineage. The manner in which the canine is worn suggests it lacked a honing complex, a trait seen in many apes in which the back edge of the upper canine is sharpened against the front part of the lower premolar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paleoanthro.org/static/journal/content/PA20060036.pdf">Debate exists</a>, though, about how forwardly placed the foramen magnum really is and if the canine’s morphology proves it is a hominin. Moreover, recent debate has focused attention on a femur that was <a href="https://www.nature.com/magazine-assets/d41586-018-00972-z/d41586-018-00972-z.pdf">found near the skull</a>.</p>
<p>I imagine if you polled three paleoanthropologists, you’d get at least five different takes on the current status of <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>. I’m honestly not sure what to think about these fossils, but they do show how interesting the study of human evolution can be!</p>
