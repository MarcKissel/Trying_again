# Biography

I received my PhD in anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014 (go Badgers!) and was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame from 2014-2017, where I worked on a project on the evolution of human symbolic thought, collaborating with scholars from philosophy, theology, psychology and other related disciplines. I am  currently an assistant professor in anthropology at Appalachian State University in North Carolina. I have published on various topics such as early hominin mandibles, semiotics, and the processes by which hominins became human. My first book, written with Nam Kim, [Emergent Warfare in Our Evolutionary Past](https://www.amazon.com/Emergent-Warfare-Evolutionary-Biological-Anthropology/dp/1629582670) was published in March of 2018.
