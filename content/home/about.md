# Biography

I received my PhD in anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014 (go Badgers!) and was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame from 2014-2017, where I worked on a project on the evolution of human symbolic thought that, intersecting with scholars from philosophy, theology, psychology and other related disciplines. I am  currently a visiting assistant professor in anthropology at Appalachian State University in North Carolina. I have published on various topics such as early hominin mandibles, semiotics, and the processes by which hominins became human. My first book, written with Nam Kim, Emergent Warfare in Our Evolutionary Past will be published in March of 2018.
