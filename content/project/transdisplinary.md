My postdoc at Notre Dame was co-sponsored by the [Center for Theology, Science and Human Flourishing]( http://ctshf.nd.edu/). I worked alongside theologians, philosophers, psychologists, and other scholars tracking the evolution of human wisdom. As a trained anthropologist, I will admit that when starting this project my knowledge of what theologians did was pretty rudimentary. However, after numerous conversations Iâ€™ve come around to the notion that such discussion are not only fruitful, but necessary. Discussions about human origins are by their very nature political ones and we need to be cognizant of how the facts of human evolution can often be misused, intentionally or not, by people wishing to cause divisions and create hostile situations between groups. 
Some of this work has been published in a new book [The Evolution of Human Wisdom]( https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Human-Wisdom-Celia-Deane-Drummond/dp/1498548458) which I can highly recommend to anyone interested in these kinds of conversations.
