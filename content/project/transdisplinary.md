My postdoc at Notre Dame was co-sponsored by the [Center for Theology, Science and Human Flourishing]( http://ctshf.nd.edu/). I worked alongside theologians, philosophers, psychologists, and other scholars tracking the evolution of human wisdom. As a trained anthropologist, I will admit that when starting this project my knowledge of what theologians did was pretty rudimentary. However, after numerous conversations I’ve come around to the notion that such discussion are not only fruitful, but necessary. Discussions about human origins are by their very nature political ones and we need to be cognizant of how the facts of human evolution can often be misused, intentionally or not, by people wishing to cause divisions and create hostile situations between groups. 
Some of this work has been published in a new book [The Evolution of Human Wisdom]( https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Human-Wisdom-Celia-Deane-Drummond/dp/1498548458) which I can highly recommend to anyone interested in these kinds of conversations. 
While working on the creation of a dataset of the fossil record of Homo sapiens I became interested the origins of interpersonal violence and warfare. Nam Kim and I have [written a book](https://www.routledge.com/Emergent-Warfare-in-Our-Evolutionary-Past/Kim-Kissel/p/book/9781629582665) that discusses the evolutionary arc of human warfare. This book details the anthropological data on violence and the emergence of warfare, providing a holistic anthropological view of the question of when war began. We argue that “emergent warfare” must be considered in association with “emergent peace,” as the same capacities that make us human allow us to interact and socialize in very complex ways also give us creative ways to organize our behaviors, whether violent or nonviolent. This manuscript will be published in March of 2017 by Routledge.

This research has led to a new project that examines the question of whether violence has declined or increased over our evolutionary history. It brings together ethnographic, archaeological, and biological data. Some of this research has recently been published in PNAS (Oka et al. 2017), looking at factors that effect the size of war groups. See the blog section of this site for more detail
